Building a solid foundation in the Common Core starts with mastering the concepts introduced in Piscine Reloaded.
This project revisits essential C programming topics that you’ll rely on throughout the curriculum, including:

  - Dynamic memory handling (allocation and freeing)

  - Working with strings and arrays

  - Control flow with recursion and loops

  - Fundamental algorithms and structured logic

Reaching the maximum score demonstrates a strong grasp of these basics, making the transition to future projects much smoother. For anyone preparing for the Common Core, completing this project with 100% is highly recommended! 🚀

## 🎯 Best Practices for Piscine Reloaded

    ✅ Pay close attention to the subject – even small details can affect the result.  
    ✅ Stick to the allowed functions – avoid using restricted ones like `printf()` in some tasks.  
    ✅ Run norminette often – keeping your code within 42’s standards saves time later.  
    ✅ Test thoroughly – try edge cases to uncover hidden bugs.  
    ✅ Write clear comments – it will help you (and others) understand the code later.  
    ✅ Don’t be afraid to ask – teamwork is encouraged, but always make sure you truly understand the fix.
